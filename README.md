# PIG GAME

This is a simple dice game created with html, css and vanilla javascript.

## How the game works

- The game has two players who take turns rolling a dice. 

- Each player's score starts at 0 and the value of the dice they rolled gets added to their current score. 

- If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and the turn switches to the other player. 

- To avoid losing their current score, they can hold the score and add it to the their total score, switching to the other player after.

- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
